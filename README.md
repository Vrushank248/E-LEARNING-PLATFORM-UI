**DESCRIPTION**: This is an interactive and visually fun front end for an e-learning platform to give users an immersive learning experience. Called EduLearn, the platform has a seamless interface to explore and register for courses, track progress and access embedded video content. The goal of this project was to design a multi page front end that is both functional and beautiful for modern learners.

The landing page grabs users attention with its clean and professional design. At the top the navigation bar has the essential links Home, Courses, About Us, Contact and My Courses so users can easily navigate through the platform. The black and white color scheme with subtle blue and purple accents is a balanced design that’s modern and fun.

The header has the platform name EduLearn and a tagline “Explore top rated courses and upskill!” Below the tagline is a search bar where users can search for courses by title, topic or instructor. This is crucial for the user to have a personalized experience and find courses that match their interests.

The course listing section has a card based layout with each card having the course title, instructor name and a “Register Now” button. The use of colors and course icons add to the visual appeal of the course listing.

The design is focused on accessibility so users of all technical backgrounds can use it. Each “Register Now” button is styled to grab attention and prompt the user to take action. Hover effects and subtle animation adds interactivity to the platform and makes it feel dynamic and responsive.

The multi page structure of the platform has separate pages for course details, user progress tracking and video embedding. While the landing page introduces the user to the available courses, other pages are designed to enhance the learning experience. For example the Progress Tracking page allows the user to track their progress through visual indicators like progress bars or percentages. This helps the learner to stay motivated and track their achievements over time.

The Video Embedding feature allows users to access the course videos directly on the platform without the need for external links. The video player is styled to match the theme of the platform for a consistent and immersive experience. This is especially important for an e-learning platform where users should not be distracted from learning.

Overall this project shows my ability to design and build a functional and beautiful front end for a modern e-learning platform. It demonstrates my understanding of user centric design, responsive layouts and interactive features. This is a great addition to my portfolio.
